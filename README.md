# MDP_STM
STM32, Containing the entire repo for the hardware side of STM. Includes Ultrasonic sensors, PID for straight line movement using Gyro, Infrared sensors to detect obstacles at the side, as well as encoder to measure distance, and well as turnings using gyro.

Tips for future groups:
Please Look out for which pins to connect to for the pins configuration. Know where they are before you connect. Read the data Sheets.

Code wise: try to finish up the basic movements before week 7 which is checklist.

Week 8 onwards is the start of the calibrating of turns etc with algo side, try to sync your turns with what is potrayed in the algorithm.
